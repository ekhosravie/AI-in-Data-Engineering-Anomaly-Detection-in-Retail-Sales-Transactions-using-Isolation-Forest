Hello and welcome to our YouTube tutorial on anomaly detection in retail sales transactions 
using AI in data engineering!
Today, we're going to explore an exciting use case that demonstrates how to identify unusual 
and potentially fraudulent activities in a retail company's sales data by leveraging 
artificial intelligence techniques within the data engineering domain.
Our goal is to provide you with hands-on experience and insights to help you understand the 
process of detecting and handling anomalies in large datasets.

To begin, let me present the scenario that we will be working with:

Scenario: 
A retail company has a large volume of sales transactions and is interested in detecting anomalous transactions,
such as unusually large purchases or transactions involving a high number of different products.
By identifying these anomalies, the company can take appropriate actions, like alerting fraud detection teams, 
reviewing business processes, or improving their data quality.


Why use AI in data engineering?

AI and machine learning can help data engineers by automating repetitive tasks, improving accuracy,
and making more informed decisions based on data. In this example, using an Isolation Forest model 
to detect anomalies in retail sales transactions can help the company identify unusual behavior and act accordingly.







In today's tutorial, we'll delve into the fascinating world of anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm 
with PySpark.
But first, let's address a crucial question: Why Isolation Forest?


Why Isolation Forest?

Isolation Forest is a powerful algorithm designed for efficient and effective anomaly detection. 
Traditional methods often struggle with high-dimensional data and complex relationships between features. 
Isolation Forest, on the other hand, excels in isolating anomalies by focusing on the inherent characteristics 
that make them stand out.






What is the Isolation Forest Algorithm?
The Isolation Forest algorithm is a tree-based model that operates on the principle of isolating anomalies rather 
than profiling normal instances.

Here's a brief overview:

Randomized Partitioning: 
The algorithm randomly selects a feature and splits the data along that feature. 
This process continues recursively until anomalies are isolated into shorter paths.

Anomaly Scoring: Anomalies are identified by their shorter paths in the tree structure. 
Since anomalies are less likely to follow the same patterns as normal instances, they require fewer splits to be 
isolated.


Ensemble of Trees: 
The algorithm builds multiple isolation trees, and the ensemble's 
collective decision helps improve the overall accuracy of anomaly detection.

Why Isolation Forest Stands Out:

Efficiency: 
Isolation Forest is particularly efficient in high-dimensional datasets, making it suitable for various 
real-world applications.

Scalability: 
The algorithm works well with large datasets, making it a robust choice for big data scenarios.

Versatility: 
Isolation Forest is less sensitive to the shape and distribution of the data, making it versatile across 
different types of datasets.
